# LearningJournal

I'm creating this project as an accountability tool for personal learning
and development.

The premise is for use cases that go something like this:

On Monday, you read a few articles about some up and coming tech.
On Tuesday, you watch a few videos on youtube from someone in tech you follow. These
videos directly pertain to *things* you're wanting to learn.
On Friday, you start a course on Pluralsight/Udemy, etc.

The following week you get busy. Not much down time to learn new stuff.

So 2 weeks later you can get back to what you were working on ... which was ?? Gosh,
what video did I watch. It made some real good points about observables and promises,
but...Wait, I read a few articles too. Where were those? Plural Sight...YES! I'll
pick up where I left off.

And just like that, the learning from 2 weeks ago is rendered fairly stale. So you spend who knows how much time just remembering where you left off. Additionally, this learning approach, unless well planned beforehand, is a pure shotgun attempt at learning. 

What is the focus? What is the primary learning goal? What steps did I take towards
that learning goal? Am I going off on a tangent with tech that's not really supporting
my primary learning goal? Or do I need to do a course correction and take my learning
ambitions into a different direction?

This project is an attempt to coral all that learning energy, focus it towards a 
well-defined goal, and help you keep context of the steps you take towards that goal.

So the next time you get busy, come back 2 weeks, 3 weeks, or even a month later,
you come to your Learning Journal and see exactly what you last reviewed, what your main
takeaways were, and let you get back to your learning with as little revamp as possible.

Another use case is for scenarios when we master certain tech bits and can no longer 
recall exactly how we got to the point of learning we did. That's pretty useful information for others to have. It's also useful to us personally because it gives 
at least a few data points on a tested and proven learning approach which could possibly
be adapted for other technologies on our "some day I'll learn that" list.
